# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp

# Avoid soiling the git repo when running on Mac
.DS_Store
/**/.DS_Store
/**/**/.DS_Store

# Avoid soiling the repo when running on production environment
/public/assets/*
/vendor/bundle/*

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/config/master.key

# These files need amendment to run in production environment
# I copied the old development versions to 'old_name.sample', as reference
# (except for puma.rb, tmp/pids and tmp/sockets, which did not exist before)
# And prevented git from detecting future changes with "git rm -r --cached 'old_name'"
